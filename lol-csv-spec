Lol-csv Spec Sheet
________________________________

One Page Website

Has a single entry field which takes Summoner Names
Once a summoner name has been given, the app makes a call to the LoL API (get summoner by name) for the Summoner Name, retrieving the summoner ID.

Once a Summoner ID is present, the app makes a call to matchlist for that summoner ID, retrieving all matches from May 01, 2014 to the present.

Call match on all of the summoner's retreived matches. Format the match data in a csv just like we did in the lol-aggregator with a few exceptions.
There will be no team call, so there will be no team information. Thus, do not include the Team-ID or Roster Member fields. Additionally, do not include the teammate fields (who was in that game with you).

Once complete, have a download link to the generated CSV pop up

--Elsewhere on the page should be an example csv. Lets generate a csv with this program and then scrub the summonerID from the csv (to protect the test subject's identity, which will likely be me :P )
